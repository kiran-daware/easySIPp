# kSipP - for Everyone!

SipP is a powerful tool for VoIP testing in the telecom world, but it often requires command-line expertise. 
kSipP aims to bridge this gap by providing a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) built with Django and Python.

## Features:
- Simplified Configuration: Easily create and edit SipP scenarios without needing to write complex command-line arguments.
- Intuitive Interface: A well-designed GUI streamlines the process of defining SIP messages, call flows, and test parameters.
- Effortless Execution: Launch your SipP tests with a click â€“ no more manual command-line manipulation.
- Visualized Results: Gain insights into test outcomes through clear and concise visualizations.

## Who's it for?

- VoIP Testers: Save time and effort with a streamlined SipP testing experience.
- Network Engineers: Quickly validate SIP functionality without extensive command-line knowledge.
- Developers: Easily integrate SipP testing into their development workflows.
